There has been significant research on formal verification of correctness of pipeline. Most of this research has
focused on pipelines in processors~\cite{bd:pipeline,bt:pipeline,sh:pipeline,pm:pipelines,rh:pipelines,aagard-day:compare}.
%~\cite{aagard-day:compare} 
%provide a comprehensive overview of this work.
Our work has similarities in formalization of pipelines. However, there is a difference in requirements due to the domain of application. In particular, while processor pipelines require proof of correspondence
between a single sequential design and its pipelined
counterpart, our work targets an algorithm for synthesizing pipelined designs. On one hand, our verification problem is harder since it
focuses on a synthesis algorithm rather than an individual
design.  On the other hand, since we are using a simple algorithm with no optimizations, our pipelined design is simpler as compared to a synthesized pipelined design.

Our work has parallels in software pipelines as well. Recently, Tristan and Leroy~\cite{tl:software-popl10}
present a verified translation validator for software loop
pipelines: their algorithm checks that a pipelined
loop is equivalent to the sequential counterpart. However,
their correctness statement is contingent upon the equivalence of symbolic simulation of the two designs.
