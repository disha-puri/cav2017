%Behavioral Synthesis is the process of compiling an Electronic System Level (ESL) design in high-level languages such as C, C++ or SystemC into Register-Transfer Level (RTL) implementation in hardware description languages such as Verilog or VHDL.
%Loop pipelining is a critical transformation in this process, which improves the throughput and reduces the latency of the synthesized hardware. It is complex and error-prone, and a small bug can result in faulty hardware with expensive ramifications. Therefore, it is critical to certify so that designers can trust the behavioral synthesis process. Certifying a loop pipelining transformation is however, a major research challenge as there is a huge semantic gap between the input sequential design and the output pipelined implementation, making it infeasible to verify their equivalence with automated sequential equivalence checking (SEC) techniques.

%Certification of a loop pipelining transformation is possible by a combination of theorem proving and SEC: (1) creating a certified pipelining algorithm which generates a reference pipeline model by exploiting pipeline generation information from the synthesis flow ({\em e.g.}, the iteration interval of a generated pipeline) and (2) conduct SEC between the synthesized pipeline and this reference model. A key and arguably, the most complex component of this approach is development of the certified loop pipelining algorithm. We propose a framework of certified pipelining primitives which we show are essential for designing pipelining algorithms. Using our framework, we build a certified loop pipelining algorithm. 
%We also propose a key invariant in certifying this algorithm, which links sequential loops
%with their pipelined counterparts. This is unlike other invariants that have been used in pipeline proofs. 
%This certified algorithm is essential in the overall approach to certify behaviorally synthesized pipelined designs. We test the scalability and robustness of our algorithm on industrial-strength ESL designs that result in tens of thousands of lines of RTL implementations.

Behavioral synthesis is the process of compiling an Electronic System Level (ESL) specification of a hardware design to an RTL description.  Loop pipelining is a critical transformation employed by behavioral synthesis, and ubiquitous in commercial and academic behavioral synthesis tools. In this paper, we provide an approach to certify loop pipelining transformation.  Critical to the approach is the development of a formal, mechanically verifiable loop pipelining algorithm.  We have built a framework of certified pipelining primitives which are essential in any pipelining algorithm. We show how to construct a certifed loop pipelining algorithm using our primitives and mechanically certify it using the ACL2 theorem prover.  We integrated our algorithm within a  behavioral synthesis certification flow, and used it to verify ESL designs synthesized by a commercial behavioral synthesis tool. A strong positive in our work is that theorem proving is necessary only for a specific algorithm; this is done only once for the whole certification flow, not per design.
