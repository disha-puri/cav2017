\section{Viability of our Approach}
\label{sec:SEC}

We have successfully tested the pipeline reference model generated by our certified algorithm with that generated by the previous algorithm~\cite{kechengthesis} across several ESL designs in different application domains(c.f Figure~\ref{fig:testing}). The designs are non-trivial to pipeline with varied pipeline intervals and depths.
