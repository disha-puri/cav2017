\section{Viability of our Approach}
\label{sec:SEC}

As mentioned earlier, the viability of this approach was tested in~\cite{kechengthesis}. They used a pipelining algorithm to generate a pipeline reference model and compared their pipelined 
implementation with pipelined RTL using SEC to justify their approach. If we replace their algorithm with our certified algorithm and still produce the same pipelined implementation with same shadow registers and data propagations, we can claim that our algorithm is also suited for certifying behaviorally synthesized designs. We have successfully tested the pipeline reference model generated by our certified algorithm with the pipelined reference model generated by the previous algorithm across several industrial strength designs in different domains(c.f Figure~\ref{fig:testing}). The test designs are non-trivial to pipeline with varied pipeline intervals and depths and require data forwarding and use of temporary shadow registers to remove data hazards.
