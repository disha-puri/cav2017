To certify behaviorally synthesized pipelined designs, we require a certifiable loop pipelining algorithm to generate a pipeline reference model. The reference model can then be compared with pipelined RTL generated by industrial synthesis tools using SEC. We have identified three pipelining primitives to create certifiable pipelining algorithms. We have also shown how to create a simple certifiable loop pipelining algorithm in behavioral synthesis using our primitives. 

We need to expand the interchange primitive to include the microstep with a conditional branch. The proof of the three primitives is still a work in progress. Also, we need to formalize the proof for converting an unrolled pipelined loop to a pipelined loop with a loop edge. We believe our framework can be extended to algorithms with complicated heuristics as well. In future, we would also explore the possibility of extending this to function pipelines.
